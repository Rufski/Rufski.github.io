# PMU project part 1: Prologue

*On the stupid and less stupid ways of making money through horse races*



## Quick story

In my early 20s I was dumb enough that I came to believe in that "one weird trick found by a single mom in your area" I once bumped
into. It took me 10 years to realize that trick had a name: martingale. For those unfamiliar with the term, martingales are a class
of betting strategies that appeared in XVIIIth Century France. The simplest of those strategies goes like this:

> Given a game where you have a 50% chance of winning twice your bet and a 50% chance of losing your bet, follow the strategy below:
> - bet one unit for a given game;
> - if you lose, keep betting until you win, each time twice the amount you previously bet;
> - if you win, return to the first step.
