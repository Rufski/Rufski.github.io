# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A few years ago I dipped a finger into the DS gears, been stuck against the machine ever since. This blog showcases the product of sleepless nights (half of them in Seattle, what do you know) spent on personal projects.

Daytime I spend on my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, designing new metamaterials through CST simulations and researching more efficient property characterization algorithms. And when everything fails I take a hike on <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/tiger-mountain-trail">Tiger Mountain</a> or hop on a stage and tell <a href="https://themoth.org/">a story or two</a>.

<b>Iâ€™m currently looking to get hired at a Data Scientist!</b> Looking for work in the US, Europe or Japan. Have a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wegrowski/">LinkedIn</a> and send me a message there!
