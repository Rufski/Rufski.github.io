<h2> In 60s or less:</h2>
  <div>As part of the S2DS bootcamp/hackaton, in partnership with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), I worked in a team of 5 to quantify the decrease over time of the capacity of a solar farm to produce electricity. This post presents the problem statement and my own contributions to this team project.</div>
  <br>
  <div>The performance of solar farms, as with any other piece of electric equipment, declines over time. Because solar-generated electricity is still a young commercial practice (95% of solar farms being less than 10-year-young), little is known about how badly various factors (geographical location, weather, dust) affect electricity generation.</div>
  <br>
  <div>Our team's task was to come up with a method that analyzes the amount of electricity produced over time at a given solar farm, and detect and quantify the effects that cause the electricity production to decrease over time. In particular, our team was focusing on 1) material ageing, and 2) material soiling.</div>
  <br>
  <div>My contribution to this project was to:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform a thorough analysis of the data provided by EPRI, and detect anomalies that allowed EPRI to revise their solar farms simulations (from which the data was produced);</li>
    <li>Develop a neural network that quantifies the material ageing based on the electricity production of a solar farm, with an accuracy 5 times that of the industry's current practice;</li>
    <li>Present a layman-accessible introduction to the business and technical case of the project to other businesses partnering with the S2DS bootcamp.</li>
  </ul>
