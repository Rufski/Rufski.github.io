<h2> In 60s or less:</h2>
  <div>As part of the S2DS bootcamp/hackaton, in partnership with the Electric Power Research Institute, I worked in a team of 5 to quantify the decrease over time of the capacity of a solar farm to produce electricity. This post presents the problem statement and my own contributions to this team project.</div>
  <br>
  <div>The performance of solar farms, as with any other piece of electric equipment, declines over time. Because solar-generated electricity is still a young commercial practice (95% of solar farms being less than 10-year-young), little is known about how badly various factors (geographical location, weather, dust) affect electricity generation.
