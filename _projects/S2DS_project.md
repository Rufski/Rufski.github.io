  <div>As part of the S2DS bootcamp/hackaton, in partnership with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), I worked within a team of 5 to quantify the decrease over time of the capacity of a solar farm to produce electricity. This post presents the problem statement and my own contributions to this team project, mainly:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Perform a thorough analysis of the data provided by EPRI, and detect anomalies that allowed EPRI to revise their solar farm simulations (from which the data was produced);</li>
    <li>Develop a neural network that quantifies the deterioration of electricity production due to material ageing with an accuracy 5 times greater than the industry's current tools;</li>
    <li>Present a layman-accessible introduction to the business and technical case of the project to other businesses partnering with the S2DS bootcamp.</li>

As part of the [S2DS](http://www.s2ds.org/) bootcamp/hackaton, in partnership with the [Electric Power Research Institute](https://www.epri.com/) (EPRI), I worked within a team of 5 to quantify the decrease over time of the capacity of a solar farm to produce electricity. This post presents the problem statement and my own contributions to this team project.

### The business case
The performance of solar farms, as with any other piece of electric equipment, declines over time. This can be due for instance to the natural ageing of the material used, or to other factors such as dirt or snow damaging the photovoltaic cells. Because solar-generated electricity is still a young commercial practice (95% of solar farms being less than 10 years young), little is known about how badly those factors affect electricity generation. Yet this information is crucial to the industry: it is estimated that **80 million dollars** could be saved **each year** by having an accurate estimate of the long-term impact on electricity production of weather, dust and material used.

To respond to this demand, our team was asked to come up with methods that analyze the amount of electricity produced over time at a given solar farm, and return a history over the same period of time of two indexes representing the impact on electricity production of, respectively, the material's natural ageing, and the dirt on photovoltaic cells. Such method could then be applied to existing solar farms so as to classify them according to these indexes, and identify common factors among solar farms whose electricity production degrades the most quickly.
