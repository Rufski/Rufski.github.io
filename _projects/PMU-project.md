<h2> In 60s or less:</h2>
In this data science project, I will collect and analyse data from horse races in France over the period 2004-2019. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the races results to the end of either:
<ol>
  <li> generating revenues from application of the model's prediction to races while keeping the probability of the gambler's ruin minimal</li>
  <li> generating revenues from a commercial distribution of those predictions, with substantiated claims that those predictions have a better accuracy than the claims of tip-selling competitors</li>
</ol>

Prospects of the project include:
<ul>
<li> web scraping / data cleaning</li>
<li> data analysis of the races and horses</li>
<li> clustering analysis to estimate if there are special categories of races and horses</li>
<li> logistic regression using machine learning methods / deep learning methods to predict the results of a given race</li>
<li> reproducing research methods to improve the model</li>
</ul>

<h2>The program</h2>

<a href="https://rufski.github.io/blog/PMU-1-prologue">Part 1 - Prologue</a>
<i>Where I explain how I experienced first-hand the statistical fallacy of a martingale, what sparked a renewal in motivation to work on horse races again, and the roadmap I will be following.</i>

<a href="https://rufski.github.io/blog/PMU-2-scraping">Part 2 - Scraping</a>
<i>Where I present the procedure I followed for scraping the data from the website www.turf-fr.com. Includes the list of features of the dataset and their significance, as well as a few hurdles I encountered on the way.</i>
