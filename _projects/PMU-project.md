<h2> In 60s or less:</h2>
In this data science project, I will collect and analyse data from horse races in France over the period 2004-2019. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the races results to the end of either:
<ol>
  <li> generating revenues from application of the model's prediction to races while keeping the probability of the gambler's ruin minimal</li>
  <li> generating revenues from a commercial distribution of those predictions, with substantiated claims that those predictions have a better accuracy than the claims of tip-selling competitors</li>
</ol>

Prospects of the project include:
<ul>
<li> web scraping / data cleaning</li>
<li> data analysis of the races and horses</li>
<li> clustering analysis to estimate if there are special categories of races and horses</li>
<li> logistic regression using machine learning methods / deep learning methods to predict the results of a given race</li>
<li> reproducing research methods to improve the model</li>
</ul>
