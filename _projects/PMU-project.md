This repository hosts a data science project that will consist in the collection and analysis of data from horse races in France over the period 2004-2019.

Prospects of the project include:
- web scraping / data cleaning
- data analysis of the races and horses
- clustering analysis to estimate if there are special categories of races and horses
- logistic regression using machine learning methods / deep learning methods to predict the results of a given race.
To be updated weekly.</div>
