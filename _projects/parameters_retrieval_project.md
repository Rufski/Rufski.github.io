<h2> In 60s or less:</h2>
  <div><b>In plain English:</b> this program takes in the result of a physics simulation of some material and outputs plots of various characteristics of this material. Picture a software simulating light being shined upon a piece of glass at various frequencies: the software returns four numbers for each light frequency; this program takes the lists of these four numbers over a certain span of frequency and plots frequency-dependent characteristics of this piece of glass, such as its capacity to bend light.</div>
  <div><b>More exactly: </b>this program takes as input the S-parameters generated by a simulation through the software CST Microwave Studio, and extract the permittivity, permeability, impedance, refractive index, figure of merit, transmission and reflection parameters of the simulated material, outputting a set of plots of these parameters over the range of frequency over which the simulation was carried out.</div>
